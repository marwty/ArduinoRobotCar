An Arduino Mega 2560 board was used for this robot car.
You can let the robot drive autonomously or control it manually with the "Arduino Bluetooth Control" app.
The speed can also be controlled via the app. The HC-05 module was used for the Bluetooth connection.
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor was used to enable the robot to detect obstacles in autonomous mode.
This is connected to a servo that swivels slightly while driving so that obstacles can be detected more easily when the robot approaches them at an angle.
The robot can also swivel the ultrasonic sensor when an obstacle is detected so that it moves in the direction where there is more space.
